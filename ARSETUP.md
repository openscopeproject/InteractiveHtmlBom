# AR Functionality Setup Guide

The InteractiveHtmlBom plugin's AR functionality uses MindAR for image tracking and requires users to provide .mind files for their PCB.

## System Requirements

### Browser and Network Requirements

- **Localhost Access Required**: AR functionality must be accessed via localhost (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/bom.html` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080/bom.html`) or HTTPS. The `file://` protocol cannot access camera.
- **Internet Connection Required**: AR functionality requires downloading external JavaScript libraries (A-Frame and MindAR) from CDN. Ensure stable internet connection during first load.
- **Modern Browser**: Supports WebRTC and camera access (Chrome 67+, Firefox 63+, Safari 11+, Edge 79+)
- **Camera Permission**: Browser must have permission to access device camera for AR tracking

### Hardware Requirements

- **Device Camera**: Built-in or external camera capable of capturing video
- **Adequate Lighting**: Good lighting conditions for optimal AR tracking performance
- **Stable Surface**: Recommended to place PCB on stable, non-reflective surface during AR use

## What are .mind files

.mind files are image tracking target files used by MindAR, containing feature point information for AR tracking. You need to create separate .mind files for the front and back sides of your PCB.

## Creating .mind files

### Step 1: Capture PCB Images from KiCad 3D Viewer

**IMPORTANT: You must use KiCad 3D Viewer, following these steps:**

1. **Open KiCad 3D Viewer**:
   - In PCB Editor, click `View` â†’ `3D Viewer`

2. **Set Orthographic Projection Mode**:
   - In 3D Viewer, click `View` â†’ `Projection` â†’ `Orthographic`
   - **CRITICAL: Must disable perspective mode, use orthographic projection**

3. **Capture Front Image**:
   - Click `View` â†’ `Preset Views` â†’ `Top`
   - Use mouse wheel to zoom, ensure PCB fills the entire view
   - **IMPORTANT: Image edges must be tight against PCB, no extra white space**
   - Take screenshot and save as `pcb_front.png`

4. **Capture Back Image**:
   - Click `View` â†’ `Preset Views` â†’ `Bottom`
   - Use mouse wheel to zoom, ensure PCB fills the entire view
   - **IMPORTANT: Image edges must be tight against PCB, no extra white space**
   - Take screenshot and save as `pcb_back.png`

### Step 2: Use MindAR Online Tool

1. Visit [MindAR Image Target Creator](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile)
2. Upload `pcb_front.png`
3. Click "Compile" to generate .mind file
4. Download the generated .mind file, rename to `pcb_front.mind`
5. Repeat steps 2-4, upload `pcb_back.png` to create `pcb_back.mind`

### Method 2: Using MindAR CLI Tool

If you have Node.js environment, you can use command line tools:

```bash
# Install MindAR CLI
npm install -g @hiukim/mind-ar-js-cli

# Create .mind file for PCB front
mind-ar-js-cli compile --input pcb_front.png --output pcb_front.mind

# Create .mind file for PCB back
mind-ar-js-cli compile --input pcb_back.png --output pcb_back.mind
```

## Configure AR in Plugin

1. Open PCB file in KiCad
2. Run InteractiveHtmlBom plugin
3. In settings dialog:
   - Check "Enable AR functionality"
   - Select "Front PCB Mind File": choose your front .mind file
   - Select "Back PCB Mind File": choose your back .mind file
4. Generate BOM

## AR Functionality Features

### Real-time PCB Overlay

- **Live Camera Feed**: View your physical PCB through device camera
- **Digital Overlay**: Interactive BOM components overlaid on physical PCB in real-time
- **Component Highlighting**: Click on physical components to highlight in BOM table and vice versa
- **Layer Switching**: Toggle between front and back PCB views while maintaining AR tracking

### AR Controls and Interface

- **AR Status Indicator**: Shows current AR tracking status (Searching, Tracking, Lost)
- **Opacity Control**: Adjust transparency of digital overlay (0-100%) for better visibility
- **Manual Lock Feature**: Lock AR position to prevent tracking drift during extended use
- **Layer Toggle**: Switch between front (F) and back (B) PCB layers in AR view

### Manual Lock Functionality

The manual lock feature helps maintain stable AR positioning:

1. **Auto-tracking Mode** (Default): AR system continuously tracks PCB position
   - Adapts to PCB movement and camera angle changes
   - May occasionally experience tracking drift or jitter

2. **Manual Lock Mode**: Freeze AR overlay at current position
   - Click the lock button (ðŸ”“) in AR interface to enable lock mode
   - AR overlay becomes fixed relative to camera view
   - Useful for detailed component inspection without tracking interference
   - Click lock button again (ðŸ”’) to return to auto-tracking mode

**When to Use Manual Lock:**
- During detailed component examination
- When experiencing tracking instability
- For precise component identification tasks
- When PCB is in optimal tracking position

## Network and Security Considerations

### Internet Connectivity Requirements

AR functionality requires internet access for:

- **External Libraries**: Downloads A-Frame (WebXR framework) and MindAR libraries from CDN
- **First Load**: Initial library download (~2-3MB total)
- **Offline Use**: After first successful load, libraries are cached for offline use
- **CDN Dependencies**:
  - A-Frame: `https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js`
  - MindAR: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mind-ar@1.2.5/dist/mindar-image-aframe.prod.js`

### Localhost and Protocol Requirements

- **Required**: Must use localhost server (http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1) or HTTPS
- **File Protocol**: Direct file:// access **NOT SUPPORTED** - cannot access camera
- **Remote Hosting**: Requires HTTPS for camera access
- **Security Context**: Camera access requires secure context (HTTPS or localhost only)

### Privacy and Security

- **Local Processing**: All AR processing happens locally in browser
- **No Data Upload**: PCB images and .mind files remain on your device
- **Camera Access**: Only used for AR tracking, no recording or transmission
- **Network Traffic**: Only for downloading required JavaScript libraries

## PCB Image Requirements

**Must use KiCad 3D Viewer screenshots, not physical photos!**

For optimal AR tracking performance, your PCB images must meet:

- **Use KiCad 3D Viewer**: Must be screenshots from 3D Viewer, not physical photos
- **Orthographic Projection**: Must disable perspective mode, use orthographic projection
- **Standard Views**: Use Top view (front) and Bottom view (back)
- **Tight Cropping**: Image edges must be tight against PCB, no extra white space
- **High Resolution**: Recommend at least 1200x800 pixels
- **Clear Features**: Include components, silkscreen, traces and other identifiable features
